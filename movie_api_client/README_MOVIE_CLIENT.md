This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Introduction

This is a movie client using The Movie Database (TMDb) API. This movie client fetches movie data from four selections: now playing, popular, top rated, and results from a movie search. When the application launches, it displays movies from the selection that are now playing. The navigation bar at top has links to redirect to different selections such as top rated movies, popular movies, now playing (default when the application starts) and a search bar (for any movie). This application uses React Router to redirect to different components, uses Redux for state management of the application, and uses Jest with Enzyme for testing components and redux actions. This application requires an API key provided by The Movie Database for requests with their API. The API key needs to be saved in a .env file with the variable name of REACT_APP_API_KEY.

## Components logic and tests

There are three main files that deal with the setup of the application such as the redux store, react router, and regular React setup. Root.js (at the root of src/) does the setup for the redux store, index.js (at the root of src/) does the React setup for the ReactDOM, and App.js (at the root of components/) does the React Router setup for the components.
<br>
<br>
The component located at the root path "/" is the NowPlaying component, which launches the redux action to dispatch and return the data for the NowPlaying component through the now_playing props.
<br>
<br>
The component located at "/popular" is the Popular component, which launches the redux action to dispatch and return the data for the Popular component through the popular props.
<br>
<br>
The component located at "/top-rated" is the TopRated component, which launches the redux action to dispatch and return the data for the TopRated component through the top_rated props.
<br>

## Redux Actions, State, and tests

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**
